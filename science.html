<!-- <h1>AMEGO: The All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory</h1> -->
	
<p>The three groundbreaking capabilities of AMEGO continuum sensitivity, 
nuclear line spectroscopy and polarization combine to address questions 
in the following key science areas. </p>

<h3>Understand the formation, evolution, and acceleration mechanisms in astrophysical jets</h3>
	<p>Blazars are the most powerful subset of AGN. Their relativistic jets are oriented close to our line of sight and emission from these jets dominates their broadband emission. In many blazars, known as MeV blazars, the peak energy output is in the MeV band i.e. in the AMEGO band. MeV blazars have larger-than-average jet power and accretion luminosity and are often found at very large redshift. They harbor the most massive black holes, with masses exceeding a billion solar masses <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...837L...5A">link</a>. </p>
	<p>AMEGO will offer a unique view into blazars' emission mechanisms. Observations of the poorly explored 0.3--100~MeV energy band with AMEGO will measure their SEDs and variability with unprecedented sensitivity and link the observed characteristics to crucial physical parameters of these systems, such as the maximum energy to which particles are accelerated, the strength of the magnetic fields, the content of the jet, and the location of the gamma-ray emission site. The polarization measurement capability of AMEGO provides a crucial test of the jet content, because hadronic models predict a much higher degree of polarization than leptonic models.</p>
        <p>The detection and characterization of the MeV blazar population is critical to understand black hole formation and growth at high redshift.  Its ground-breaking sensitivity and all-sky survey capability ensure that AMEGO will measure the properties of a large sample of MeV blazars.</p>
<h3>Identify the physical processes in the extreme conditions around compact objects</h3>

<h3>Measure the properties of element formation in dynamic systems</h3>

<h3>Test models that predict dark matter signals in the MeV band</h3>

<p>The nature of dark matter is crucial to our understanding of the structure and evolution of the Universe after the big bang.  AMEGO will be the most sensitive probe  in the MeV energy range to gamma-ray signatures to two leading dark matter candidates:  Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) and axion like-particles (ALPs).  This makes it an ideal instrument for dark matter searches.</p>

<p>WIMP dark matter naturally arises in extensions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model">Standard Model</a> of particle physics. Typically WIMPs are thought to have masses &gt1 GeV, which produce gamma rays with energies starting in the &#126;100 MeV range.  AMEGO is ideal for searching for low-mass WIMP dark matter with the necessary precision in the MeV range for detection.</p>

<p>ALPs interacting with photons in the presence of external magnetic fields lead to energy-dependent mixing similar to <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.37.1237">neutrino oscillations</a>.  These oscillations yield distinctive features in the energy spectra of the target observed. Ideal targets have known large magnetic fields, such as magnetars, blazars and galaxy clusters.  Gamma rays from these sources often times traverse multiple magnetic-field  environments in which gamma rays could convert into an ALP and vice versa.  AMEGO is, with its low energy threshold, large field of view, and excellent angular resolution, the perfect instrument to search for such a signal and will extend these searches to ALP masses by orders of magnitude. The sensitivity surpasses that of current and planned dedicated ALP laboratory searches.</p>
